Hey guys! Refer to the following functions in Player.cpp:

(I did not include the parameters for these functions in this post. I used typedefs, so use the appropriate
typedefs for the driver program you will be testing the modified functions in:
  - typedef char (*grid)[10]       //typedef that defines a pointer to a grid (2D array)
  - typedef vector<Ship *> (USS)   //typedef for a vector of pointers to a ship instance
Volley() - void function with no return value, generates the coordinates to shoot and updates the grid
Impact() - resloves the hits or misses, as well as informs whether a ship has been sunk, returns a short
GetCoord() - boolean function, returns T or F if the coordinates generated are valid

These functions should be modified for the Medium mode AI. If you have any questions
or need any input, feel free to ask me. Iterating through the grid should be easy using
bracket notation, since we only need to worry about adding an offset of 1 to the appropriate
coordinate/s to move in any direction.

Impact currently has no return statement, that gives us a way to extend functionality.
Maybe return the value of the ship that was sunk, as a short(ex., if Aircraft Carrier was sunk, return 5),
so we can keep track of which ships are still in play. What do you think?

Also, GetCoord() will need to be revised, or may even be unnecessary.
