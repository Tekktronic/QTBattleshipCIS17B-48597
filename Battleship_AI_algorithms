Hey guys.. Found a Battleship AI algorithm page for our Easy, Medium, Hard, and Nightmare(?) Mode:

http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html

I think this page would be a very good starting point, but we would have to translate all these steps into code.
The first mode, Easy, is just random targeting. We can do this one with our eyes closed using a
simple random number generator. THe other 3 (or 4) are more difficult to work out, code-wise. We'd
have to discuss this at length. Thanks. If you have any other suggestions, feel free to post them
or send them through mass text. Thanks again!
